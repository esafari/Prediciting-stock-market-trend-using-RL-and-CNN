Developing stock trading strategy can be seen as one of the most attractive, profitable yet challenging decision-making problem due to its complex nature. Deciding on the right time to show the best trading action of buy/hold/sell the stocks can cause a huge gain or loss in investment. Reinforcement learning is a machine learning method for learning intelligent behavior in complex environments. On the other hand, deep learning methods and especially convolutional neural network (CNN) are powerful and efficient pattern extraction methods. Hence, in this paper a CNN is employed and tuned by double Q-learning to develop an effective stock trading strategy. The time series of stock price variations is converted to a 3D tensor. This has the advantage of representing a more thorough picture of the stock's past conditions and aid in selecting the appropriate action. In this work, two trading agent are introduced which are different in interpretation of the 3D tensor. A novel reward function is also applied to boost the performance of the intelligent agents. Utilizing the proposed strategy, the algorithm is applicable to short, medium and long term investments in addition to reach better performance in compare to other related approach.
